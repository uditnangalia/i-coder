                HMS Erin was a dreadnought battleship of the Royal Navy, originally ordered by the Ottoman government
                from the British Vickers Company. The ship was to have been named Reşadiye when she entered service with
                the Ottoman Navy. The Reşadiye class was designed to be at least the equal of any other ship afloat or
                under construction.[1] When the First World War began in August 1914, Reşadiye was nearly complete and
                was seized at the orders of Winston Churchill, the First Lord of the Admiralty, to keep her in British
                hands and prevent her from being used by Germany or German allies. There is no evidence that the seizure
                played any part in the Ottoman government declaring war on Britain and the Triple Entente.

                Aside from a minor role in the Battle of Jutland in May 1916 and the inconclusive Action of 19 August
                the same year, Erin's service during the war generally consisted of routine patrols and training in the
                North Sea. The ship was deemed obsolete after the war; she was reduced to reserve and used as a training
                ship. Erin served as the flagship of the reserve fleet at the Nore for most of 1920. She was sold for
                scrap in 1922 and broken up the following year.
